This is significantly shorter than most signing keys used by distribution/software maintainers, hence our use of bundled keyring via the staker-repo package to support key rotation.
In practical terms a key isn&amp;rsquo;t used to sign releases for the full 3 years period as the key rotation needs transition periods. Therefore, the key lifecycle is as follows:</description></item><item><title>Package Signature Validation</title><link>https://deb.staker.ltd/docs/advanced-topics/package-signature-validation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deb.staker.ltd/docs/advanced-topics/package-signature-validation/</guid><description>The problem with package signatures Debian and derivatives (including Ubuntu) do a poor job (read: none) at checking the signatures of the packages themselves. SecureApt is only signing the repository manifest and the repository manifest contains hashes for all of the packages which are part of a release.
Nonetheles, we sign all of the packages which we include in our repository using dpkg-sig. So, for the paranoids out there (which is factory settings for seasoned security professionals), there&amp;rsquo;s a digital signature to indicate that the package build happened under our control.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure</title><link>https://deb.staker.ltd/docs/advanced-topics/infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deb.staker.ltd/docs/advanced-topics/infrastructure/</guid><description>Design The DEB repositories themselves are nothing fancy. All they require is a basic HTTP server to be delivered.
Our repositories are published as Cloudflare pages and delivered via Cloudflare. This allows us to provide them at no cost for the community besides our use cases.
Signing key delivery Our signing keys are delivered initially from Keybase i.e for repository bootstrap procedure. This is by design. If the signing key and the repository are delivered by the same server (which is a common example for quite a few software vendors), then the trust can not be established as the chain of custody may be broken.</description></item></channel></rss>
